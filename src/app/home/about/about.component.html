            &nbsp;Hello! My name is Azat Farmanyan, and I am a creative and innovative developer and designer with a degree in Information Systems and Technologies, which I obtained in 2023 from Samtskhe-Javakheti State University, Faculty of Engineering, Agriculture, and Life Sciences.
          </p>
          <p class="text paragraph">
            &nbsp;My journey began at <a href="https://www.epam.com/" target="_blank"><b>Emap</b></a>, where I mastered front-end development through an intensive course at RsSchool and successfully applied the knowledge in practice, participating in real projects and obtaining certification. My experience at <a href="https://www.apacer.com/" target="_blank"><b>Apacer Technology Inc.</b></a> and <a href="https://bet888win.net/" target="_blank"><b>Bet888win</b></a>, where I worked as a graphic designer, allowed me to create visually captivating promotional banners and adapt them for various social platforms, contributing to successful marketing campaigns.
          </p>
          <p class="text paragraph">
            &nbsp;At <a href="https://geoalphasolutions.com/" target="_blank"><b>GeoAlphaSolution</b></a>, I made significant contributions to projects such as <a href="https://www.faircontent.media/home" target="_blank"><b><u>FairContent.media</u></b></a> and <a href="http://www.swiftness.co.il/" target="_blank"><b><u>Swiftness</u></b></a>.

          <p class="text paragraph">
            &nbsp;In <a href="https://www.cyberiasoft.com/" target="_blank"><b>CyberiaSoft</b></a>, I spent a year and three months enhancing web store management systems, utilizing HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular to create user-friendly interfaces. My work with GitLab and REST APIs, along with the implementation of responsive design techniques, increased user satisfaction and ensured productive collaboration with cross-functional teams.
