            I have extensive knowledge and a passionate interest in continually exploring innovations in stimulating
            fields. My professional experience spans over three years in front-end development, with a primary focus on
            <span class="bold-txt">Angular,</span>
            including
            <span class="bold-txt">JavaScript</span> and <span class="bold-txt">TypeScript.</span> Additionally, I have
            over five
            years of experience in
            graphic design.
            <br /><br />
            My skills encompass deciphering complex code bases, where I excel in understanding existing processes and
            efficiently solving related tasks. My ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and methodologies, such
            as
            <span class="bold-txt">Node.js, </span>
            <span class="bold-txt">Sass, </span> <span class="bold-txt">SCSS, </span>
            <span class="bold-txt">REST API, </span> and <span class="bold-txt">ES6, </span> allows me to integrate them
            effectively. I am characterized by
            critical thinking, a strong work ethic underscored by flexibility, a willingness to take on new
            responsibilities,
            a commitment to learning opportunities, and the ability to interact with new systems. <br /><br />

            These traits are supported by my interpersonal communication skills, enabling me to collaborate seamlessly
            with
            cross-functional teams. I am proficient in version control tools such as <span class="bold-txt">Git</span>
            and
            <span class="bold-txt">GitHub,</span> and I have a solid foundation in web design using <span
              class="bold-txt">HTML,
              CSS, HTML5,</span>
            and <span class="bold-txt">CSS3.</span> My experience with REST API, JavaScript frameworks, and libraries
            such as
            <span class="bold-txt">RxJS</span> and <span class="bold-txt">JSON API</span> complements my qualifications
            in
            front-end development.
            Additionally, my design skills extend to
            <span class="bold-txt">Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator,</span> and <span class="bold-txt">Figma,</span>
            enhancing
            my ability to create
            visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.<br /><br />In conclusion, my versatile skill set, including
            but not
            limited to <span class="bold-txt">JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Git,</span> and <span
              class="bold-txt">Adobe
              Creative Suite,</span>
            positions me as a versatile and adaptive professional with a strong commitment to delivering high-quality
