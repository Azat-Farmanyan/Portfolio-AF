            I have extensive knowledge and a passionate interest in continually exploring innovations in stimulating
            fields. My
            professional experience spans over three years in front-end development, with a primary focus on Angular,
            including
            JavaScript and TypeScript. Additionally, I have over five years of experience in graphic design.
            <br /><br />
            My skills encompass deciphering complex code bases, where I excel in understanding existing processes and
            efficiently
            solving related tasks. My ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and methodologies, such as Node.js,
            Sass, SCSS,
            REST API, and ES6, allows me to integrate them effectively. I am characterized by critical thinking, a
            strong work ethic
            underscored by flexibility, a willingness to take on new responsibilities, a commitment to learning
            opportunities, and
            the ability to interact with new systems. <br /><br />

            These traits are supported by my interpersonal communication skills, enabling me to collaborate seamlessly
            with
            cross-functional teams. I am proficient in version control tools such as Git and GitHub, and I have a solid
            foundation
            in web design using HTML, CSS, HTML5, and CSS3. My experience with REST API, JavaScript frameworks, and
            libraries such
            as RxJS and JSON API complements my qualifications in front-end development. Additionally, my design skills
            extend to
            Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Figma, enhancing my ability to create visually appealing and
            user-friendly
            interfaces.<br /><br />In conclusion, my versatile skill set, including but not limited to JavaScript,
            TypeScript, Angular, Git, and Adobe
            Creative Suite, positions me as a versatile and adaptive professional with a strong commitment to delivering
            high-quality work in front-end development and graphic design.<br /><br />
